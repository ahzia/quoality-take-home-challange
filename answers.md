### ⭐️How long did you spend on the coding test?
(2 Days) As you can see in the commit history I did the first commit on 30 march, and the last commit related to main features implementation on 31 march, 

### ⭐️What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I will create a frontend so you can try out diffrent endpoints, and will write Unit test and Integeration tests for the API. 

### ⭐️What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language/framework? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

For the javascript I used ES6 syntax, as I think it is more clean, and have good new features and make the code more readible.
All the functions, files, ... has been writed in ES6 Syntax and I also used JavaScript modules syntax for import and exports.

###⭐️How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I can monitor these metrics to truck down performance issues:
System health and downtime
Resource utilization
API latency
Error rates and handling
Application, Database and Deployment log
I can also use monitoring tools for my Node JS app to ensure optimal performance, and I can also keep an eye on:
For the database, I used mongodb cloud to deploy my database and I can use diffrent [MongoDB Monitoring strategies](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/monitoring/) to keep an eye on the database proformance.
As I deployed my project in Heroku so I can use [Heroku Connect Diagnostics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-connect-diagnose) to Diagnosing Heroku Connect Performance Issues.
